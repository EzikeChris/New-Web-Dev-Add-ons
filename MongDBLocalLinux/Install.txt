This brief tutorial shows students and new users how to install MongoDB database server on Ubuntu 20.04 | 18.04.

MongoDB, a free open source, NoSQL High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database can be used to create powerful websites and applications.

MongoDB is already in Ubuntu default repositories, however, the version in Ubuntu repositories isn’t the latest and greatest.

In order to install the latest, you must install MongoDB package repository on Ubuntu, and this tutorial will show you how.

When you’re ready to get MongoDB installed, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Add MongoDB Package repository to Ubuntu
In order to get the latest version of MongoDB, you must add its repository to Ubuntu.. to do that, run the commands below to add the official repository key.

wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -



NEXT================>

After adding the repository key to Ubuntu, run the commands below to add MongoDB repository to your system…

echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list




Step 2: Install MongoDB on Ubuntu 18.04
Now that the repository and key have been added to Ubuntu, run the commands below to install the package.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mongodb-org



Step 3: Manage MongoDB
After installing MongoDB, the commands below can be used to stop, start and enable MongoDB to automatically startup when the systems boots up.

sudo systemctl stop mongod.service
sudo systemctl start mongod.service
sudo systemctl enable mongod.service
By default, MongoDB listens on port 27017.. after installing, the local server should be able to communicate with MongoDB.. to verify whether MongoDB is running and active, run the commands below:

sudo systemctl status mongod

You should see something like the lines below:

mongod.service - MongoDB Database Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-05-21 12:37:32 CDT; 52s ago
       Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual
   Main PID: 3409 (mongod)
     Memory: 72.7M
     CGroup: /system.slice/mongod.service
             └─3409 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf

CONNECT TO MONGO SHELL VERY FUNDAMENTAL =======>

To connect to MongoDB shell, run the commands below:

mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017

You should see something like the lines below:

MongoDB shell version v4.2.6
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?compressors=disabled&gssapiServiceName=mongodb
Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("1b88c27f-e477-4a29-b562-835ee56591b5") }
MongoDB server version: 4.2.6
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
For interactive help, type "help".


Step 4: Adding Admin User
By default, authentication is not enabled for MongoDB users. In production environment, it may be required to secure your server and enable user authentication.

Use the steps below to do that.

If you want to enable authentication, run the commands to create a new admin user after you’ve logged into MongoDB server.

> use admin

Then run the commands below to create a new admin user

> db.createUser({user:"admin", pwd:"new_password_here", roles:[{role:"root", db:"admin"}]})

You should see a successful admin user created

Successfully added user: {
	"user" : "admin",
	"roles" : [
		{
			"role" : "root",
			"db" : "admin"
		}
	]
}
Exit and continue below to enable MongoDB logon authentication.

Run the commands below to open MongoDB config file..

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/mongod.service
Then change the highlighted line to look like the one below and save…

[Unit]
Description=High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database
After=network.target
Documentation=https://docs.mongodb.org/manual

[Service]
User=mongodb
Group=mongodb
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --auth --config /etc/mongod.conf
PIDFile=/var/run/mongodb/mongod.pid
# file size
Save and exit

Restart MongDB to make the changes apply.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo service mongod restart
After installing MongoDB, its default configuration file is located at /etc/mongod.conf.

It is recommended to enable authentication since all users can access the database without authenticating.

To do that, open the configuration file by running the commands below:

sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
Then edit the line shown below to enabled:

security:
  authorization: enabled
Restart MongoDB services after making the changes above.

sudo service mongod restart
Now only authentication users will be allowed to access the database server.

mongo -u admin -p new_password_here --authenticationDatabase admin
Run the commands below to verify that authentication is enabled.

mongo -u admin -p --authenticationDatabase admin
You should then be prompted for a password.


Step 5: Completely Remove MongoDB
To completely remove MongoDB from a system, you must remove the MongoDB applications themselves, the configuration files, and any directories containing data and logs.

Stop the database server

sudo systemctl stop mongod.service

Remove all packages

sudo apt purge mongodb-org*

Finally, remove MongoDB databases and log files.

sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb
sudo rm -r /var/lib/mongodb
That’s it!
